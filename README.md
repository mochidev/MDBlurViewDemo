MDBlurView Demo
==================

Important!
----------

As of recently, Apple has been [rejecting](https://github.com/mochidev/MDBlurView/issues/4)
apps that use `MDBlurView`. To work around this, place the following set of defines at the
bottom of your `*Project*-Prefix.pch` file, so that MDBlurView can no longer be found via
static analysis:

```objc
#ifndef DEBUG

#define MDBlurView CheeseSandwichView
#define MDBlurLuminosity CheeseSandwichLuminosity
#define MDBlurLuminosityAutomatic CheeseSandwichLuminosityAutomatic
#define MDBlurLuminosityBright CheeseSandwichLuminosityBright
#define MDBlurLuminosityDark CheeseSandwichLuminosityDark

#define blurFraction cheeseSandwichFraction
#define blurRadius cheeseSandwichRadius
#define blurLuminosity cheeseSandwichLuminosity
#define _blurFraction _cheeseSandwichFraction
#define _blurRadius _cheeseSandwichRadius
#define _blurLuminosity _cheeseSandwichLuminosity
#define setBlurFraction setCheeseSandwichFraction
#define setBlurRadius setCheeseSandwichRadius
#define setBlurLuminosity setCheeseSandwichLuminosity

#endif
```

**Do not forget** to rename the occurances of `cheeseSandwich` in the above sample code to
a **new** string of your choosing, otherwise Apple will end up blocking `CheeseSandwichView`s
as well ðŸ˜‰.

Note that *you* can continue referencing `MDBlurView` in your code â€” the only difference will
be that when it is compiled, it'll be replaced which whatever you renamed it with in the above defines.

Purpose
-------

`MDBlurView` is a multiuse background view you can use for bluring in your iOS 7 Apps.
In addition, it provides some customizable properties that all adhere
to `UIAppearance`, including some novel ones such as masking. Please visit the [MDBlurView](https://github.com/mochidev/MDBlurView)
repository for the actual code :)

If you use `MDBlurView` in your app, please add it to the
[list](https://github.com/mochidev/MDBlurViewDemo/wiki/Apps-That-Use-MDBlurView)!

Installation
------------

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mochidev/MDBlurViewDemo --recursive
```

To include it into your own projects either download the
[source](https://github.com/mochidev/MDBlurView), or run the following
on your git repo:

```bash
$ cd <your_repo>
$ git submodule add git@github.com:mochidev/MDBlurView.git <local_subpath>/MDBlurView
```

This will allow you to update it at anytime by running `$ git submodule update`.

Usage
-----

Simply add the
[MDBlurView](https://github.com/mochidev/MDBlurView) submodule to
your project, and add an `MDBlurView` to your view, either in Interface Builder,
or in code:

```obj-c
MDBlurView *blurView = [[MDBlurView alloc] initWithRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 100)];
```

Notes
-----

In the background, `[MDBlurView](https://github.com/mochidev/MDBlurView)` uses `_UIBackdropView` to generate the blur, generated by using a `UINavigationBar`, and gutting its internals. For this reason, Blurs are not available pre-iOS 7 (because the lack of UIBackdropViews), nor are they available on devices where Blur is disabled (like the iPhone 4).

Internally, it seems that `_UIBackdropView` uses three CAFilters on its layer to acheive the effect.
